# E-Commerce-Back-End
Back end for an e-commerce website, specifically dealing with stocked products that are organized into categories and also given tags.


## What was the motivation?

To learn what Sequelize is and how it can be advantagous to use over using MySQL directly. It's an ORM that can turn MySQL tables into models that JS can understand. It also offers association methods so that models can have relationships between them. Soft deletion is another advantage Sequelize has where data is NOT removed once and for all from the database, as it would be if it was deleted through MySQL.

These advantages are enough to warrant learning Sequelize as it is very practical.


## What problems does it solve?

Most businesses, especially larger ones, need a way of storing and accessing data important to running and growing the business. If you're dealing with a large amount of data, MySQL is a fantastic way of storing and organizing all your data. This includes everything from user accounts to inventories.

On the coding side of things, using Sequelize along with Express made creating a database easier and more intuitive than doing it directly through MySQL. Using models as tables, as an example, is much simplier to deal with. 


## What did you learn?

>* How to connect to a database using Sequelize, with the help of an environment variable file.

>* Using the command "npm run seed" to seed a database without being in MySQL shell.

>* Using Insomnia to more easily test and perform RESTful CRUD operations.

>* How to create models in JS that act like tables in a MySQL database.

>* How to code GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests with Express.
